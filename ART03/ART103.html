			When I was very young, my grandmother always gave me a Temari ball that she made for my birthday. <br>
			This kind of ball represents the moral of good happiness. I like it very much. It meant a lot to <br>
			 me as a child. But when I grew up, my grandma could not spend such a long time making a bow-ball.<br>
			  So I learned from the Internet and did it. I hope I can give it to my grandma when I return home.<br>
			 <br>
			 I wound the cotton with a white thread to form a ball, then measured the circumference, calculated <br>
			 the position of each petal, and began to embroider the innermost petal with a needle. The process of <br>
			  sleeve petal is from inside to outside. After embroidering both sides twine the line of cyan in the <br>
			  middle as adornment.

			Title:      Japanese Horror Video Art<br> 

			Year:      2020<br>

			Medium:    Full HD Color Video <br>
			Description:    The art of Japanese horror films is something I've always loved.<br>
			This is a horror video modified by Pr software by recording a video of my friend and me. <br>
			I think scary movies are the little thrills of daily life. We don't often feel fear in daily life, <br>
			but fear is also a normal human emotion, so I made this horror film to let myself pursue excitement<br>
			  and feel fear in daily life.</font></h4></center>
