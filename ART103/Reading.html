			<h3>
				<center><font face="times" color="#07376A">
						Q1. -- What is a good working definition of what a System is and perhaps what it is not? <br>
					</font></center></h2>

					<h4>
						<center><font face="times" color="#4682b4"> 
						A regularly interacting or interdependent group of items forming a unified whole, <br>
						such as an assemblage of substances that is in or tends to equilibrium. a group of <br>
						devices or artificial objects or an organization forming a network especially for <br>
						distributing something or serving a common purpose. 	<br>
						</font></center></h4>
					
						<h3>
							<center><font face="times" color="#07376A">
						Q2. -- For the 4 system definitions you were to look up please give in your own <br>
						words what they mean and give an example of them for each case. <br></font></center></h2>


						<h4>
							<center><font face="times" color="#4682b4"> 					
						Modularity, Decomposability, Emergence and Chaos Theory.<br></font></center></h4>

						<h3>
							<center><font face="times" color="#07376A">
						Q3 -- Give us your defination of what Tesslation means and give an example you<br>
						 encountered, not mentioned in the reading.<br> </font></center></h2>

						 <h4>
							<center><font face="times" color="#4682b4"> 
						 A tessellation is a pattern of shapes that fit together through a system of geometric patterns. <br>
						 They can be used in many architectures and geometries.<br></font></center></h4>
						 <h3>
							<center><font face="times" color="#07376A">
						Q4 -- What is the difference between ideas of Modularity and Tesselation? What are<br> 
						the properties that are in oppostion with each other?<br> </font></center></h2>

						<h4>
							<center><font face="times" color="#4682b4"> 	
						Modularity componants of a system that can be arranged in a variety of configuations<br>
						 or roles (very interchangeable)<br>
						 Tessellation: When a geometric shape is repeated over and over again, covering a <br>
						 plane of tiles without any gaps or overlaps, it results in a tessellation - a mosaic <br>
						 pattern of a mesmerizing visual effect.<br> </font></center></h4>

						 <h3>
							<center><font face="times" color="#07376A">
						Q5 -- What is the difference between designing something that has Complexity (aperiodic)<br>
						 vs being Uniform (periodic)<br> </font></center></h2>
	
						 <h4>
							<center><font face="times" color="#4682b4"> 
						A signal that repeats its pattern over a period is called periodic signal.  A signal that<br>
						 does not repeats its pattern over a period is called aperiodic signal or nonperiodic.<br></font></center></h4>

						 <h3>
							<center><font face="times" color="#07376A">
						Q6 Group Activity. Each student will need to Bring in a series of 8 diagrams that show <br>
						evidence of Modularity, Decomposability, Emergence and Chaos Theory.<br>
						</font></center></h2>
