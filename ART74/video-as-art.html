		Title: Microcosmos to World                                                         .<br>
		Date: March 16th, 2020                                                              .<br>
		Medium: Premiere Pro, Music                                                         .<br>
		Dimension: 1920x1080                                                                .<br>
		Description: This is focusing on the Medical Microcosm, I want to turn the whole video's <br>
		feeling into a mysterious and melancholic environment by using color bluish-green and blue.<br>
		 Also, I want to talk about video projection in a glass container to imitate a larger version<br>
		of the container to store these microscopic creatures, because in real life these tiny things <br>
		can only be seen through a microscope. I found some related videos from the website, <br>
		using Premiere Pro to collage them. At the end of the video, I use the earth to show the earth <br>
		is created by these wholes. The video is from the beginning of the process of dividing the fertilized egg,<br>
		 which shows that people grow from the initial cells. Later I showed videos of red blood cells, <br>
		 white blood cells,and platelets moving in blood vessels, and then the structure of nerve tissue, <br>
		 which finally constituted the most important part of the entire human body: the heart. These short videos<br>
		are used to show that after we grow up, life is composed of different things. Although their size is very <br>
		small, they are still important. Behind a video of the human skull formation process, looks very strange.<br></font></h5></center>

				Title: Cat Can Really Dance<br>
          Year: 2020<br>
          Medium: Full HD Color Video, 00"13"00<br>
          Description: The cat called our cat, which is really famous in the internet <br>
          because it looks very funny and silly. I got inspire from the song "You can really dance".<br>
           So I combine them, and choose a very very very famous Japanese song as the background music. <br>
           I use Adobe primer to make collage. Most important thing in doing the duplicate cat is <br>
           the correct use of super key in Pr. I found several dance video of mur cat and Pikachu.</font></h5></center>

						Title:      Japanese Horror Video Art<br> 

						Year:      2020<br>
			
						Medium:    Full HD Color Video, 00"13"00<br>
						Description:    The art of Japanese horror films is something I've always loved.<br>
						This is a horror video modified by Pr software by recording a video of my friend and me. <br>
						I think scary movies are the little thrills of daily life. We don't often feel fear in daily life, <br>
						but fear is also a normal human emotion, so I made this horror film to let myself pursue excitement<br>
						  and feel fear in daily life.</font></h5></center>
