				Title: Microcosmos to World<br>
				Year: 2020<br>
				Medium: Premiere Pro, Music<br>
				Dimension: 1920x1080<br>
				Description: This is focusing on the Medical Microcosm, I want to turn the whole video's
				feeling into a mysterious and melancholic environment by using color bluish-green and blue.
				Also, I want to talk about video projection in a glass container to imitate a larger version
				of the container to store these microscopic creatures, because in real life these tiny things 
				can only be seen through a microscope. I found some related videos from the website, 
				using Premiere Pro to collage them. The video is from the beginning of the process of dividing 
				the fertilized egg, which shows that people grow from the initial cells.</font></h5>

Title:      Japanese Horror Video Art<br> 

				Year:      2020<br>
	
				Medium:    Full HD Color Video <br>
				Description:    The art of Japanese horror films is something I've always loved.
				This is a horror video modified by Pr software by recording a video of my friend and me. 
				I think scary movies are the little thrills of daily life. We don't often feel fear in daily life, 
				but fear is also a normal human emotion, so I made this horror film to let myself pursue excitement
				  and feel fear in daily life.

		Title: Cat Can Really Dance<br>
          Year: 2020<br>
          Medium: Full HD Color Video<br>
          Description: The cat called our cat, which is really famous in the internet 
          because it looks very funny and silly. I got inspire from the song "You can really dance".
           So I combine them, and choose a very very very famous Japanese song as the background music.
           I use Adobe primer to make collage. Most important thing in doing the duplicate cat is 
           the correct use of super key in Pr. I found several dance video of mur cat and Pikachu.</font></h5>

					Title: Life In Quarantine  <br>	

					By: Xiaozhen Liu <br>	
					
					Medium: Adobe Premiere, Photoshop, camera  <br>	
					
					Dimension: 1920x1080p <br>	
					
					Description: For this video, I try to make it have more interesting story line.  
					It begins with I saw the email  sent from school that said campus closed for one week,
					 and then all classed moved to online. Here I used a piece of music that is very  popular 
					 in China to show my happiness. Then is an emotional transition. Since the homework and 
					 pressure, I became very tired. The angels and demon part present my conflicting idea with 
					  living in outbreak of Covid-19. There is an Easter eggs at the end of video.  
					
					I want to be able to document some important moments in my life,  just like this outbreak. 
					 Although life has become very different, everyone stays at home and work online, it is also 	
					 a very valuable memory. </font></h5></center></P>
