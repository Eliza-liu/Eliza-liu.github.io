					Art Statement
				
				</font><br><br>
	I'm  a  digital  media  artist  who's  interested  in  Japanese  Art, Handicraft 
				production, and video design. My  artworks  focus  on  3D  modeling, internet 
				culture, and hand-making. Most of my artworks are made by Photoshop Adobe Premiere.
			I want to give people the visual experience by using video art, code programming, 
				 and digital illustration.<br>
				   My video art includes many short video cuts and design, and my original horror 
				short film. I like the Japanese horror art style such as Curse. I imitated the 
				Japanese horror theme and recorded original horror short films and design back-view 
				audio materials. I like to show my audience the emotional feeling. 
			  My hand-making artworks are a lot. It includes 3D artworks and 2D design.
			  <br>
			 One of my favorite artwork is Temari Ball. It cast me a long time to learn and make.
				For 2D design, I made a book that talks about Japanese  fairy  tales  on  Fushimi  
				Inari  Taishawith Japanese stab binding. Inside  the  book  are  Osaka  castle  tower, 
				Japanese flag, fox and cat mask, torii in the lake, Inari god in Japanese mythology, 
				and Inari god is drawn into a humanoid with a pencil drawing. I made the cover of this 
				book with cardboard, and then wrapped a layer of watercolor paper on the surface and 
				painted Torii with orange as the main background color. The purpose of this book is to 
				express a characteristic stab binding style of Japan, and the content is also a theme 
				of ancient Japanese mythology. I chose the binding style of Japanese stab binding and	
				 hand-painted my favorite Inari God, Torii and other pictures symbolizing happiness 
				 and peace as the content of the book.
				 <br>
				I currently studying  at  San  Jose  State  University.                          
				 I am happy to share my artworks with you!
