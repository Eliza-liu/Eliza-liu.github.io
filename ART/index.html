					Art Statement
				
				</font><br><br>
				I'm Xiaozhen Liu, you can also call me Eliza. I am a digital media artist who's currently 
				studying at San Jose State University as a senior student. My artworks now are focusing on
				 3D modeling, internet culture, and Video design. For 2D design, I am familiar with Adobe 
				 Illustrator and Photoshop; for 3D modeling, I can use Autodesk Fusion 360 and Blender. By
				  the way, I have two years of study in computer science, therefore, the programming languages
				   I am familiar with are java, part of C#, and simple web programming (HTML). Video design is
					my favorite part, most of the videos are made by Adobe Premiere and some special effects 
					part is made by Adobe Effect. I want to give people the visual experience by using video
					 art, code programming, and digital illustration. I want to show strong emotion to my 
					 audience and give people the visual experience by using video art, code programming, and 
					 digital illustration.
			  <br><br>
			  When I was in high school, domestic digital media art gradually appeared in people's lives, such
			   as the emergence of many novel interactive interfaces. I also learned about 3D modeling because 
			   of watching domestic animation. When I went to university, I often saw some famous artists' works
				about DMA on Instagram, such as Farid Shukurov and Claudia Hart. The fancy artworks make me very
				 envious and tempted. My major was Computer Science from Spring2018 to Fall 2019. However, I think
				  programming is too simple and boring for me. I love the unrestrained style of art, I hope that 
				  my future life can become a part of art, so I decided to switch to Digital Media Art major. 
				  During taking the Digital Media Art course last semester, I like ART75's video design. I learned 
				  the use of much interesting software, such as Touchdesigner and AE. I think hobbies should be 
				  enriched more deeply, rather than just a one-sided understanding; I hope I can learn more in 
				  digital media art.<br>
				 <br>
				 For example, my video art includes many short video cuts and my original horror short film. I 
				 like the Japanese horror art style such as Curse. I imitated the Japanese horror theme and 
				 recorded original horror short films and design back-view audio materials. Another special effects
				  video made with AE by using the green screen, that also contains a bit of horror, in line with 
				  the dark style of Halloween. 
				 <br><br>
				 I know that my current artwork is not so mature, or there are many areas for improvement. But I will
				  continue to learn and make my work more successful and attractive.                       
				 I am happy to share my artworks with you!<br><br>
